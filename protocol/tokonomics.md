# Tokenomics

## Tokenomics of the USDAO Protocol

The USDAO protocol utilizes three distinct cryptocurrency tokens which have different purposes. The USDAO stablecoin, as the name suggests is the 1:1 dollar pegged general use stablecoin which is accessible to all users.&#x20;

The ASSET token is provided to investors who provide liquidity into the USDAO pool, and represents their fractional ownership of the overall pool.&#x20;

The DAOGOV token is the governance token of the protocol, which allows holders to participate in decision making relating to the ecosystem.&#x20;

### USDAO Stablecoin

The USDAO minting and burning process is dependent upon the amount of Ethereum staked and unstaked in the USDAO pool. As USDAO is soft pegged to US 1 dollar it will be minted at $1.

### ASSET

The ASSET minting and burning process are depended upon the amount of Ethereum staked in the USDAO pool. The Ether that is deposited during the minting operation of either USDAO or ASSET token is deposited into the USDAO smart contract, also known as, the reserve pool. The reserve pool is the backbone of the whole system as it determines the health of the economy of the system. It helps determine the price of the ASSET token as well as determine the debt ratio.

### DAOGOV

DAOGOV is the governance token of the USDAO ecosystem to make decisions on the future of the ecosystem which will be operable by the community.

There will be only 21,000,000 DAOGOV governance tokens will be minted. Where each token DAGOV token will represent 1 vote
