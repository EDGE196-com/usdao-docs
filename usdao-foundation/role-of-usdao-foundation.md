# Role of USDAO Foundation

The USDAO foundation is a not-for-profit corporation charged with the responsibility primarily to focus on maintaining the ecosystem and nurturing the community. However, if there occurs a situation that requires immediate action to prevent any catastrophic event the foundation holds the right to step in and take the right action. It is important to clarify, however, that the foundation would never participate or promote an action that causes an individual or a party including the USDAO foundation itself any monetary benefit.

Having said that these are few situations the USDAO foundation holds the right to take any action:

1. Upgrading or launching a new or improved version&#x20;
2. Adding new oracles or removing obsolete oracles
3. To ensure the safety of the pool and safeguarding the interests of the users during an unknown event

\
We believe in the principle of deploy and forget and we wish that there may never occur such a situation where we need to step in to safeguard our system. In the majority of the scenarios, the community shall govern the USDAO project through our governance model
