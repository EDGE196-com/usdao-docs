# USDAO Staking

## USDAO Staking

The USDAO ecosystem provides a highly competitive interest rate for the users who want to stake for the long term.

The USDAO ecosystem provides a 6% annual fixed returns in USDAO stable coin for users who participate in staking their tokens.&#x20;

In order to stake, users need to have a minimum of 100 USDAO in their wallet in order to begin staking.&#x20;

A user can stake multiple times as per his wish within the chosen staking time period.&#x20;

### Auto Staking

Auto Staking means that after a staking period ends, if the user forgets to remove their funds, staking will renew, ensuring that additional interest will be earned on the principal amount invested, and which can be claimed at any time as the claim button enables once the current staking lock period ends.&#x20;
