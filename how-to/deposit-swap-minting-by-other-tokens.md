# Deposit SWAP: Minting By Other Tokens

The users also have a choice to mint the stable coin using ERC20 tokens like Dai, AAVE, etc. To make this possible Uniswap is employed externally to the system.

Users can choose the ERC20 tokens, from the list of tokens provided by the system, to deposit as the input. Based on the current exchange rate on Uniswap the tokens are traded for Ether which ultimately is used to mint the stable coin and is returned to the userâ€™s address.

This is particularly useful for businesses operating their business in multiple cryptocurrencies.

We provided an exchange layer itself on our platform facilitating users to mint USDAO stable coin using other cryptocurrencies \(ERC20\). In the future we hold the right to add better tokens and/or blockchains for this purpose.
