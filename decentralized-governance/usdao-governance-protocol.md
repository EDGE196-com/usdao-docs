# USDAO Governance Protocol

## Introduction to the USDAO Governance Protocol

Inspired by the Compound governance protocol, the USDAO protocol employs a [decentralized governance](https://usdao.io/governance) architecture that is aimed to serve as the sole decision-making body for future changes in the USDAO stablecoin system.&#x20;

This is important to make the USDAO protocol a completely decentralized system with no single individual or institution having full control over it.&#x20;

As the future needs of the protocol and the wider market are unknown, it is important for the USDAO governance protocol to provide features that allow necessary changes to be made for the welfare of the stablecoin.&#x20;

DAOGOV is the governance token of the USDAO ecosystem, with 1 Million tokens minted. Token holders are able to create and vote on proposals to make alterations to the USDAO protocol.&#x20;
