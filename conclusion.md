### For Cryptocurrency Traders

USDAO provides an interesting and powerful alternative to the biggest stablecoins in the market. Many of these existing stablecoins are centralized, developed and managed by individual companies and consortiums which include legacy banking interests, and which suffer from lack of transparency, particularly around the question of liquidity, and this makes them risky.&#x20;

Furthermore, some of the existing decentralized stablecoins require users to provide excessive collateralization.&#x20;

The intelligent design of the USDAO protocol ensures cryptocurrency traders have access to a secure and fully backed stablecoin which meets their day-to-day needs when trading markets.&#x20;

### For Governments and NGO's

The USDAO protocol provides the basis for cross-border remittance at high speed and low-cost, allowing government bodies and NGO's to quickly deploy solutions which require the movement of large sums of money at high speed, and outside of the BIS (Bank of International Settlements). This could greatly benefit smaller nations, which may be encumbered by larger competitors.&#x20;

### For retail cryptocurrency enthusiasts

This ensures that retail users are in full control of their finances without having to rely on centralized bodies.&#x20;

Furthermore, for many of the worlds approximately 2B unbanked or underbanked individuals, the USDAO protocol allows access to the global market without the need for identity verification, which is often one of the major barriers to entry.&#x20;
