# Stack

## USDAO Tech Stack

This section outlines the core technologies used in the USDAO ecosystem, helping to provide the model for how software applications interact with the USDAO stable coin. Understanding the layers of the stack will help you understand some of the various use cases for USDAO, and how it can be integrated into different projects.
