## USDAO In Gaming and Esports

We see a huge potential for the USDAO protocol in the gaming and e-sports industry. The concept of tokens and payments has existed even before the advent of stablecoins.&#x20;

Smart contracts can be developed on top of gaming logic integrating an even more rich gaming experience powered by USDAO stablecoins and/or NFT implementations to pay revenues to content creators and owners.&#x20;

Integrating the USDAO protocol into game engines can provide an opportunity for developers to incorporate trust-less token economics, including in-app purchases and asset transfers. This ensures users can participate honestly and with the assurance of fair gameplay, liquidity and transparency.
