## How USDAO Can Be Used For Startups Seeking Funding

ICOs were a big deal back in 2017, and at the time were a great concept but which ultimately lacked security, and since anybody could launch their own ICO with little technical knowledge, hundreds of exit scams and Ponzi schemes ﬂooded the ICO market, causing many investors to lose their funds.&#x20;

With the vision to secure public offerings using cryptocurrency, and provide high-growth potential unicorns with simple tools for raising capital, the USDAO protocol provides a trust-less solution for both legitimate startups and global investors.

The platform shall harness the true potential of smart contracts and enable the funding of startups with USDAO stablecoins as input.&#x20;

To prevent a repeat of the same mistakes made by early ICO's, and to safeguard funds, investors send funds into the startup smart contract module provided by the USDAO protocol, rather than in startups directly.&#x20;

Investors deposit Ether into the startup smart contract in exchange for custom startup tokens, which represent their funding amount to a pool of startups. The Ether received from various investors shall be used to mint USDAO stablecoin by the startup smart contract.&#x20;

The startup smart contract shall be governed by a decentralized community of incubators and mentors whose primary role is to ﬁlter out all but the best performing startups and allocate stablecoin funds to them.&#x20;

This way when startups perform well, and their valuation increases, the valuation of startup tokens also increases, providing investors with additional returns. It is safer to invest in this platform than in an unknown ICO since the investment goes to a pool of startups all of which are being mentored and incubated by reputed incubators.

The dream of a truly global stablecoin cannot be achieved unless it replaces ﬁat currencies as the preferred payment asset. We intend to provide the merchants of the world with the enormous potential of blockchain technology in its most simpliﬁed form. We envisage providing a better and safer payment method alternative to the giant but centralized ﬁat institutions.

We are offering simple APIs and widgets that can be used to quickly start accepting payments in USDAO across the globe. Similar to popular centralized payment channel services like Apple Pay, GooglePay, we would soon provide a web interface with rich transaction data and other important information regarding payment activities.
