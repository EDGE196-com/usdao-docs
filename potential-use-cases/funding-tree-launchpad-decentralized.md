# Funding Tree: Decentralized Launchpad

As new breakthroughs are happening every day in the blockchain ecosystem, those changes do require a voice to be heard and funds at their disposal to bring the new frontier in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.

The Funding Tree project is a truly decentralized launchpad platform that is governed by the community, so the community will decide which project should get listed to which project should raise how much amount all through governance.
