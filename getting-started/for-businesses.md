## How Businesses and Enterprises benefit from the USDAO Protocol

The USDAO protocol has been designed with businesses in mind, with the goal to assist developers in creating commercially viable and wide-ranging products and services which integrate with existing ecosystems and new and innovative solutions.&#x20;

Ultimately, the USDAO protocol provides simplicity and security for enterprise development. The protocol does not require users to provide personal information or undergo KYC verification, as well as ensuring that there is always sufficient liquidity in the system.

Having a stablecoin which is pegged to the US dollar, and which is accessible to everyone, regardless of their nationality or status opens up many avenues of opportunity for business, and the USDAO has been created with the intention that it could be used as a global currency, outside of the control of central banks and governments.&#x20;

The USDAO protocol includes SDK's (software development kits) for developers to create new products and services allowing easy integration with Web3 projects, or as a 'bolt on' to existing website and e-commerce infrastructure.&#x20;
