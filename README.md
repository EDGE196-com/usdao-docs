## Overview

The volatility of popular digital assets, such as Bitcoin \(BTC\), Ether \(ETH\) make them difficult to be used as a common currency. ****In order to avoid such problems, many stable coins have been created, Some of them are fiat-backed \(entirely collateralized\) like USDC, USDT, TUSD, etc. Some of them are crypto-backed such as DAI. And some of them are algorithmic stable coins \(entirely algorithmic with no backing\) such as BASIS, ESD, DSD, etc. Stable Coins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the price's volatility relative to a single asset or basket of assets.

USDAO is a fully crypto asset-backed stable currency by USDAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A digital token intended to serve as a global currency. USDAO brings together familiar concepts into a never-before-seen protocol.

The motivation to develop a stable coin like USDAO is to build an enterprise-friendly, easily integrable as well as and interoperable stable coin that should not only be as reliable as fiat currencies currently are but also open new doors of possibilities for businesses using blockchain technology. We share the pain of lack of any such solution despite the market being flooded with hundreds of stable coin projects. We intend to provide a solution to this problem. We, at USDAO Foundation, have built a stable coin that should simplify transactions in business processes and extend limits for global transactions by offering faster and safer transactions, larger transaction volumes, decentralized governance, and much more advantages than both our centralized and decentralized competitors. We promise to offer simpler implementation and easy integration of our technology into your existing businesses. USDAO is powered by multiple blockchains including Ethereum which is itself a reputed and established market leader in decentralized applications technology.
